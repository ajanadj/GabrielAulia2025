                    <h2>THE 25 HORSES PUZZLE</h2>
                    <p>Uh oh! You just bought 3 unicorns, but on your way home, they ran away and got lost in a sea of 22 horses! Because you were afraid that someone might steal your unicorns on the way home, you had applied an irreversible spell that temporarily disguised them to look exactly like normal horses (which you now regret doing), so all 25 of them look identical. You need to quickly find your unicorns because your daughter will get angry if you come home late - you had promised to cook her favorite dinner tonight. But how can you find your unicorns?</p>
                    <p>Oh look, there’s a horse racing track nearby! You know your 3 unicorns are definitely going to be the fastest out of the other horses (because they're unicorns, duh). Let’s have the 25 of them race with each other to find your unicorns then. They all have different speeds, and these horses seem to be in a very good mood, so their speed will always stay constant at the time being. But it seems that the race track can only fit 5 horses at a time. Also, you have no watches or timers, and you’re in a hurry. So now, the question is, what would be the minimum number of races for you to find your unicorns?</p>
